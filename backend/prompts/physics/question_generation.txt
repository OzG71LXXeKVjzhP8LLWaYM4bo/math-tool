Generate an IB Higher Level Physics exam-style question on the topic of {{topic}}.

Requirements:
- Question must match the style and rigor of actual IB HL Physics exams
- Include realistic physical quantities with appropriate units (SI units preferred)
- Question should be solvable using standard IB Physics formulas
- Use proper LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions
- Include given values and clearly state what needs to be found
- For mechanics: use realistic masses, velocities, and forces
- For electricity: use practical circuit values
- Ensure significant figures are appropriate for the calculation

The solution_steps field is required because the app displays step-by-step worked solutions to help students learn the problem-solving process, similar to IB mark schemes.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks):
