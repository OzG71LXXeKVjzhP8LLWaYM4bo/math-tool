Generate an IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretation (AI) Higher Level exam-style question.

Topic: {{topic}}

Course Focus (AI HL):
- Emphasis on real-world applications and mathematical modeling
- Statistical analysis and data interpretation
- Technology-enhanced problem solving (but this is Paper 1 style)
- Practical contexts with meaningful scenarios

Question Style:
- Match the style and rigor of actual IB AI HL Paper 1 examinations
- Create standalone questions (no multi-part for now)
- Use IB command terms: "Find", "Calculate", "Interpret", "Determine", "Model", "Estimate", "Predict"
- Include realistic real-world context where appropriate
- Use proper LaTeX notation for ALL mathematical expressions
- Include appropriate numerical values with realistic data

Solution Requirements:
- Provide 3-6 clear solution steps following IB mark scheme style
- Each step should show the mathematical working
- Include interpretation of results where relevant
- Final answer should include units if applicable

Output Format:
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no extra text):

{
  "question": "Complete question text in LaTeX with real-world context. Use \\\\frac{}{}, \\\\sqrt{}, etc.",
  "answer": "Final answer in LaTeX format (with units if applicable)",
  "solution_steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "description": "Brief description of what this step does",
      "expression": "LaTeX showing the mathematical work"
    }
  ],
  "hints": ["Optional hint to guide student"]
}

Important:
- Escape backslashes in JSON: use \\frac not \frac
- Include real-world context (finance, science, social science, etc.)
- Difficulty should match IB HL exam standard
