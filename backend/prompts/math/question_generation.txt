Generate an IB Higher Level Mathematics exam-style question on the topic of {{topic}}.

Requirements:
- Question must match the style and rigor of actual IB HL Mathematics exams
- Include specific numerical values (avoid using letters for constants)
- Question should be solvable analytically with pen and paper
- Use proper LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions
- For calculus: include limits of integration where applicable
- For algebra: prefer equations that have exact solutions
- For statistics: use realistic sample sizes and probabilities

The solution_steps field is required because the app displays step-by-step worked solutions to help students learn the problem-solving process, similar to IB mark schemes.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "question": "LaTeX code for the question",
  "answer": "LaTeX code for the final answer",
  "solution_steps": [
    {"step": 1, "description": "First step description", "expression": "LaTeX expression"},
    {"step": 2, "description": "Second step description", "expression": "LaTeX expression"}
  ],
  "hints": ["hint1", "hint2"]
}
