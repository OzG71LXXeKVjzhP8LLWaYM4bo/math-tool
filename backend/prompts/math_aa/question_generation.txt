Generate an IB Mathematics Analysis and Approaches (AA) Higher Level exam-style question.

Topic: {{topic}}

Course Focus (AA HL):
- Emphasis on algebraic techniques and formal proofs
- Abstract reasoning and rigorous mathematical arguments
- Analytical problem solving without technology
- Mathematical elegance and theoretical understanding

Question Style:
- Match the difficulty and rigor of actual IB AA HL Paper 1 examinations
- Create standalone questions (no multi-part for now)
- Use IB command terms: "Find", "Calculate", "Hence show that", "Prove that", "Determine", "Show that", "Verify"
- Include specific numerical values that lead to clean answers
- Ensure the question is solvable analytically without a calculator
- Use proper LaTeX notation for ALL mathematical expressions

Solution Requirements:
- Provide 3-6 clear solution steps following IB mark scheme style
- Each step should show the mathematical working
- Include method marks (M1) style explanations
- Final answer should be exact (fractions, surds, π) not decimals

Output Format:
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no extra text):

{
  "question": "Complete question text in LaTeX. Use \\\\frac{}{}, \\\\sqrt{}, etc.",
  "answer": "Final answer in LaTeX format",
  "solution_steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "description": "Brief description of what this step does",
      "expression": "LaTeX showing the mathematical work"
    }
  ],
  "hints": ["Optional hint to guide student"]
}

Important:
- Escape backslashes in JSON: use \\frac not \frac
- Keep question focused on a single concept
- Difficulty should match IB HL exam standard
