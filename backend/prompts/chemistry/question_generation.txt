Generate an IB Higher Level Chemistry exam-style question on the topic of {{topic}}.

Requirements:
- Question must match the style and rigor of actual IB HL Chemistry exams
- Use realistic chemical quantities and concentrations
- Question should be solvable using IB Chemistry data booklet formulas
- Use proper LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions
- For stoichiometry: include balanced equations where relevant
- For equilibrium: use realistic Kc or Kp values
- For energetics: include appropriate enthalpy values
- Include units throughout calculations

The solution_steps field is required because the app displays step-by-step worked solutions to help students learn the problem-solving process, similar to IB mark schemes.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "question": "LaTeX code for the question",
  "answer": "LaTeX code for the final answer (include units)",
  "solution_steps": [
    {"step": 1, "description": "First step description", "expression": "LaTeX expression"},
    {"step": 2, "description": "Second step description", "expression": "LaTeX expression"}
  ],
  "hints": ["hint1", "hint2"]
}
