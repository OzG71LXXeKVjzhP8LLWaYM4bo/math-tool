Below is a deep, exam-designer level explanation of IB Mathematics: Analysis & Approaches HL (AA HL) Paper 1, Paper 2, and Paper 3, written as context your AI can directly use to decide question type, difficulty, calculator usage, structure, and marking expectations.

I’ll go beyond surface differences and explain:

intent of each paper

how IB expects students to think

typical traps

how questions are structured

what should vs should not appear in each paper

how your AI should generate questions differently per paper

IB Math AA HL — Paper Philosophy Overview

IB does not treat papers as interchangeable.
Each paper targets a different cognitive skill:

Paper	Core Skill Tested
Paper 1	Algebraic & analytical reasoning without technology
Paper 2	Mathematical modelling and interpretation with technology
Paper 3	Deep problem-solving, proof, and unfamiliar reasoning

Your AI must not generate the same style of question for all three.

PAPER 1 — Non-Calculator, Pure Mathematics
Format

2 hours

No calculator

~9–11 questions

Short → medium → extended response

Heavy algebraic manipulation

Intent (What IB is actually testing)

Paper 1 tests whether the student:

truly understands mathematics symbolically

can manipulate expressions by hand

can reason without numerical crutches

has procedural fluency + conceptual clarity

IB uses Paper 1 to separate:

“I understand why this works”
from
“I rely on my calculator”

What belongs in Paper 1

Your AI should generate:

1. Exact values only

No decimals

No numerical approximations

Surds, fractions, π, e

Examples:

Exact roots of equations

Exact integrals

Exact trig values

2. Heavy algebraic manipulation

Factorisation

Expansion

Simplification

Rearranging expressions

Examples:

Partial fractions

Binomial theorem expansions

Algebraic proofs

Completing the square

3. Analytic calculus

Differentiation from first principles

Chain/product/quotient rules

Implicit differentiation

Integration by parts/substitution by hand

4. Proof and reasoning

Induction

Deductive proof

Counterexample

Show that / Hence prove that

What never belongs in Paper 1

Your AI must avoid:

Numerical solving (solve x = …)

Graph sketching using technology

Statistical tables

Large datasets

Regression

Calculator-dependent integrals

Common IB Traps (Paper 1)

IB often:

gives expressions that look simple but require structure

hides algebraic identities inside calculus

requires rearranging before differentiation/integration

embeds proofs inside applied-looking questions

AI Generation Rules — Paper 1

Your AI should:

❌ Never require a calculator

✅ Require symbolic manipulation

✅ Reward method, not just answer

✅ Include “show that” steps

✅ Penalise sloppy algebra

PAPER 2 — Calculator, Modelling & Interpretation
Format

2 hours

Calculator required

Similar number of questions to Paper 1

Longer, multi-part modelling questions

Intent (What IB is testing)

Paper 2 tests whether the student:

can apply mathematics to real situations

understands how technology supports reasoning

can interpret results, not just compute

can choose appropriate mathematical tools

This paper is about:

“Do you know when and why to use mathematics?”

What belongs in Paper 2

Your AI should generate:

1. Real-world modelling

Motion

Growth/decay

Economics

Geometry in context

Optimization with context

2. Calculator-dependent skills

Solving equations numerically

Graph intersections

Numerical integration

Regression (linear, quadratic, exponential)

3. Interpretation questions

Explain what the value represents

Comment on reasonableness

Identify limitations of the model

These are marks your AI must explicitly generate.

4. Statistics & probability

Normal distribution

Binomial distribution

Expected value

Conditional probability

Use of GDC functions

What never belongs in Paper 2

Your AI should avoid:

Long algebraic proofs

Exact-value only questions

Induction

Deep abstraction without context

Common IB Traps (Paper 2)

IB often:

gives over-precise answers that need rounding

expects students to explain why a solution makes sense

includes extraneous information

tests understanding of model assumptions

AI Generation Rules — Paper 2

Your AI should:

✅ Require calculator use

✅ Include real-world context

✅ Ask for interpretation

✅ Accept numerical answers

✅ Include “state assumptions” / “comment on validity”

PAPER 3 — HL Extension: Deep Thinking & Unfamiliar Problems
Format

1 hour

Calculator allowed

2–3 long questions

Very high mark density

Intent (This is the HL discriminator)

Paper 3 tests whether the student:

can tackle unfamiliar mathematics

can reason without memorized procedures

can construct arguments

can connect multiple topics

This is where IB separates:

top 5–7% HL candidates

What belongs in Paper 3

Your AI must generate:

1. Unfamiliar problem settings

New functions

Non-standard definitions

Abstract structures

Multi-step reasoning

Students cannot rely on pattern recognition alone.

2. Deep reasoning over computation

Few calculations

Many explanations

Marks for logical progression

3. Multi-topic integration

Typical combinations:

Functions + calculus

Series + proof

Geometry + vectors + calculus

Probability + algebra

4. “Explore / Investigate / Hence deduce”

Paper 3 questions are often guided discovery.

What never belongs in Paper 3

Your AI should avoid:

Routine textbook questions

Simple differentiation/integration

One-step problems

Heavy calculator reliance

Common IB Traps (Paper 3)

IB often:

defines a function in a strange way

changes notation mid-question

requires noticing symmetry or invariants

includes “show that” with no obvious path

AI Generation Rules — Paper 3

Your AI should:

✅ Introduce new structures

✅ Force reasoning, not memory

✅ Allow multiple valid approaches

✅ Reward explanations heavily

❌ Avoid routine exam questions

Final Comparison (For Your AI Logic)
Feature	Paper 1	Paper 2	Paper 3
Calculator	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Context	Minimal	Heavy	Abstract
Difficulty	High algebra	Applied	Conceptual
Proof	Common	Rare	Central
Interpretation	Minimal	Essential	Conceptual
HL Extension	❌	❌	✅
